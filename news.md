## 2024
Hi, my name is Jialin and I am currently a PhD student at [Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/).

My research interest associates to probabilistic theory and information theory. I am also interested in genreral machine learning and neural network research. This blog contains some of my summery about the above topics. 

Please feel free to [contact me](https://www.dur.ac.uk/research/directory/staff/?mode=staff&id=18275) if you are interested about my work.
